      <h1>Sensible and Latent Loads</h1>
      
      <p>This three-point outline (with interspersed comments) describes how the
      calculator accounts for latent loads. This is a high-level algorithmic
      progression from operating conditions to runtimes. Portions of this are
      also discussed on the "Equipment Response to Loads" (previous) page.</p>
      
      <ol start="1">
        <li><strong>Evaporator Coil Conditions</strong>: Outside air
        (ventilation) and indoor air mix before passing over the coil.
        Conditions in the mixed stream depend on weather (outdoor dry-bulb and
        wet-bulb) and indoor air (dry-bulb, setpoint, and room
        humidity).<br>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 8px;">
        The analysis of latent and sensible loads starts at the evaporator
        coil. It is the conditions at the coil that determine how much of the
        system's total capacity is available for handling sensible loads and
        how much of that capacity will be used for dehumidification. The coil
        conditions are determined by mixed-air calculations that consider the
        contributions from the two air streams (indoor return air and outdoor
        ventilation air).
        </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <ol start="2">
        <li><strong>Latent and Sensible System Capacity:</strong> Components of total capacity are based on mixed air conditions.
          <ul>
            <li>Rated system capacities and S/T ratio (at AHRI test conditions) are projected to coil conditions.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>ASHRAE</strong> psychrometric routines (thermodynamic properties of moist air)</li>
                <li><strong>DOE-2</strong> total-capacity curves for evaporator coils
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>EnergyPlus</strong> Apparatus dew-point and
                    bypass-factor algorithms for calculating latent and sensible
                    components of total capacity</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Once coil conditions are known, then the rated capacities can be
          projected to them. This projection takes the characteristics of the
          system at AHRI test conditions (Outdoor dry-bulb = 95F, Inside
          dry-bulb=80F, Inside wet-bulb=67F) and projects to the mixed-air coil
          conditions in the simulation (as affected by indoor setpoint and
          weather-bin conditions).<br>
          
          <p style="margin-top: 8px;"></p>
          The three sub-bullets list the algorithmic sources for the projection
          calculations. The result of the projection is sensible and latent
          capacities at coil conditions. A significant portion of the
          computational code of the calculator is in support of this step.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <ol start="3">
        <li><strong>Runtimes</strong> are determined by the system's sensible
        capacity to maintain the indoor dry-bulb (satisfy sensible loads) as
        controlled by the thermostat.
          <ul>
            <li>Building<strong> Sensible </strong>Loads<strong>:</strong>
            Load-line established to match (1) the <strong>system</strong>
            sensible <strong>capacity</strong> at outdoor design conditions and
            (2) the sensible <strong>internal</strong> <strong>loads</strong>
            when outdoor conditions equal the setpoint.</li>
            
            <li>Building<strong> Latent </strong>Loads<strong>
            (condensate):</strong> Calculated using S/T ratio at coil conditions
            and sensible loads (see "LLdE" and "S/T" columns in the bin
            tables).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>This statement on runtimes reflects how a thermostatically
          controlled air conditioner works. It simply tries to keep the dry-bulb
          temperature from rising. That is, as sensible loads act to increase
          the temperature of the room air (and eventually trigger the
          thermostat), the air conditioner runs (cooling the air) until the
          thermostat says to stop.</p>
          
          <p>Runtimes are basically the ratio of the sensible load to the
          sensible capacity. So by establishing the sensible capacity of the
          system we can determine how long it has to run (to satisfy the
          thermostat).</p>
          
          <p>The first sub-bullet describes the two outdoor conditions that
          establish the sensible-load line (design and setpoint).</p>
          
          <p>While the unit runs to counteract sensible loads, it also
          dehumidifies. To calculate condensate formation (latent coil load),
          the split between sensible and latent capacities (the S/T ratio) and
          the sensible load (SL), can be used. S/T is short for the ratio of the
          sensible to total capacities.</p>
          
          <p>LL = TL * L/T = (SL/(S/T)) * (1 - S/T)</p>
          
          <p>This LL (Latent Load) is reported in the calculator as the "LLdE"
          column in the bin calculations. Another column that gives a good
          indication of how the coil conditions are affecting the sensible and
          latent capacities is the "S/T" column.</p>
          
          <p>Systems in humid climates will have a lower portion of their capacity available for sensible cooling (lower S/T ratios).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Assumptions about Indoor Humidity:</h3>
      
      <p>The two plots below show the difference between the outside and inside
      humidity ratio as a function of the outdoor-indoor temperature difference
      (left is raw hourly; right is daily average). This data is generated from
      EnergyPlus modeling of a medium-sized office building. This shows a
      positive difference during the summer cooling season (ΔT greater than
      -10), and a negative difference in winter. Summer cooling, and resulting
      dehumidification, suppresses the indoor humidity ratio.</p>

      <p>The calculator has two ways of modeling indoor humidity. The default is
      to assume that that indoor humidity ratio tracks with the outdoor humidity
      ratio. This assumption produces mixed-air (coil conditions) more humid
      than would be seen in an hourly simulation like EnergyPlus. The
      corresponding latent coil loads will be higher in the calculator than a
      corresponding hourly model like EnergyPlus. The alternate assumption of
      fixed indoor humidity assumes that some other conditioning device is
      acting to control the indoor humidity to a fixed level. The latent coil
      loads of the calculator should be similar to that of an hourly simulation which
      also uses a fixed humidity assumption.</p>
