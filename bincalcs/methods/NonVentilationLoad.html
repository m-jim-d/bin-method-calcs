            <p>
                The calculator uses weather data to conduct a binned energy analysis for the rooftop unit in cities
                across the United States. Weather tape data (outdoor dry-bulb and coincident web-bulb) was binned in 5
                degree increments and filtered by the selected occupancy schedule. The result is a database of hours (in
                each bin) and coincident wet-bulb temperatures for each city and occupancy schedule combination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step in the binned analysis is to determine the air-conditioning load for each weather bin.
                Since building characteristics are not explicitly entered for the calculator, building loads must be
                inferred by assuming the unit would be installed in a building suitable for its specified capacity. Load
                behaviors for this hypothetical building are established via a "<span style="color: red;">Total</span>"
                sensible load line and the "<span style="color: teal;">Non-ventilation</span>" sensible load line. These
                load lines are defined by the yellow line markers in the figure to the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fundamental to the cost estimator is the assumption that total sensible loads and <a class="Jump"
                    href="CoolingCorrectionCurvesSensible.html">sensible capacity</a> are balanced at design conditions.
                This balance is achieved by scaling a linear building-load model until the load equals the unit's
                capacity at design conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another principal concept is that internal gains and solar loads contribute to the total sensible load.
                This essentially produces an intercept in the load model such that there is a cooling load even when the
                outdoor temperature matches the setpoint. This two-point nature to the load model allows for
                quantitative adjustments to better reflect various building types. For example, the "Building Type"
                feature allows the user to select a building type which is internally dominated and insensitive to
                weather (high internal gains as with a multi-story office building) or one more coupled to the weather
                (low internal gains as with a warehouse). The EnergyPlus load models for each building type can be
                manually edited to produce custom versions of each model. The analysis used in developing the load
                models can be reviewed in Appendix A of the <a class="Jump"

                The calculator uses a sensible load analysis formulation. Humidity impacts on performance are accounted
                for as they affect the unit's sensible capacity to meet the total sensible load (and also the effects on
                system power draw). Interior humidity conditions can be set to automatically track the outside
                conditions (by assuming inside humidity ratio is equal to outside humidity ratio), or they can be set to
                a constant (relative humidity) value. Note that energy usage associated with other humidity controlling
                devices is not included in the estimates by the calculator.
