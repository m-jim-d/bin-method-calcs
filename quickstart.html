        <h1>Quick Start</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr">This
          outline discusses the four <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic
            modes</span>
          in which the calculator is used to represent a rooftop unit. The
          intent here is to describe the data requirements for each of
          these modes and strategies to make the best comparisons with
          consideration for data availability. This discussion will
          generally progress from low data-input requirements to high. Help on
          each of the calculator features below can be accessed by clicking on
          the info icon next to the feature's name on the calculator's
          <em>Control</em> page.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Generic</span>: </h2>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr">This is the default mode and
        uses a generic set of DOE-2 coil curves to represent all units.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">No data; a basic demo</span>: A
          simple click of the submit button will use all the default values of
          the calculator's features and will generate the basic summary output
          on the <em>Results</em> page. Turning on the "<strong>Show bin
          calculations</strong>" feature will produce a more detailed report.
          Clicking the "<strong>Advanced Features</strong>" checkbox displays
          additional calculator parameters and their default values.<br>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic description of a
              single-stage RTU</span>: This is the minimum data that
            is needed for an initial comparison of two single-stage
            units (with single-speed evaporator fans). This level of
            comparison can be done without enabling the "Advanced Features" of
            the calculator.<br>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total capacity</span>
                (and oversizing factor): The nominal size of the unit
                in kBtuh. This is the cooling capacity at AHRI test
                conditions.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">EER</span>: This is
                the energy efficiency rating of the unit at AHRI test
                conditions.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Costs</span>:
                Purchase cost (in units of k$: $1,000 = 1 k$) and
                estimate of annual costs ($).</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Economizer</span>:
                This should be checked if the unit can
                be configured for economizing and it is enabled.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The environment</span>:
            This characterizes the environment which essentially
            determines how hard (and how long) the unit will have to
            work.<br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Building type</strong>: Pick a building
                type. This establishes a building-load model that
                predicts cooling load as driven by weather data.</li>
              <li><strong>Location</strong>: Pick a state and city to
                establish the weather data used in driving the
                building-load model.</li>
              <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: Pick a schedule that best
                represents the occupancy patterns in the building.</li>
              <li><strong>Setpoint and setback</strong>: Pick a
                setpoint temperature and also a setback temperature to
                determine control points for occupied and unoccupied
                periods.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Economics</strong>: This affects the savings and
            payback calculations.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Electric Utility Rate</strong>: Enter your
                local electric rate.</li>
              <li><strong>Equipment life</strong>: This is the time
                period over which energy and cost savings are
                calculated.</li>
              <li><strong>Discounting</strong>: If it is difficult to
                estimate a discount rate, turn this feature off to
                give non-discounted (simple) payback calculations.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Generic with "Advanced features": </h2>
        <p>Clicking the "Advanced Features" checkbox reveals added features
        which allow the calculator to do more detailed modeling of the
        single-stage unit. These features also support the modeling of the more
        advanced characteristics of multi-stage and variable-capacity systems.
        Please also refer to the help topics for these features.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>More detailed</strong> representation for the
            <strong>single-stage unit</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Fan and Condenser power data</strong>: The
                "Power Inputs" feature allows the user to specify
                the three power inputs. The evaporator fan power can
                be estimated as the difference between the gross and
                net capacity of the unit (expressed in kWatts). The
                user will notice that the calculator recalculates the
                EER and condenser power if the evaporator fan or the
                auxiliary values are edited. A helpful editing pattern
                is to first edit the fan and aux fields, then re-enter
                the EER value. Clicking the "Power" button (upper
                right) will recalculate default values for the
                power parameters based on the unit's capacity and EER.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">E-Fan and Condenser</span>:
                Choose between "1-Spd: Always ON" and "1-Spd: Cycles
                With Compressor." The difference here is that one
                setting models the evaporator fan as running
                continuously and the other allows the fan to cycle off
                with the compressor. Refer to the help topic for this
                feature for additional information related to
                unoccupied hours and economizing.</li>
              <li><strong>Humidity</strong>: Generally it is best to
                leave this set to automatic unless there is data on
                internal humidity levels that might be affected by a
                separate humidity control system.</li>
              <li><strong>Ventilation</strong>: This feature value is
                automatically calculated based on building type and
                generally does not need to be edited.</li>
              <li><strong>Degradation factor</strong>: This is the
                fractional drop in efficiency of the unit when running
                at small loads. It will be difficult to get a specific
                value from a manufacturer. This can be edited to
                explore the sensitivity of the savings to changes in
                this parameter. Generally leave this at the default
                value.</li>
              <li><strong>S/T Ratio</strong>: This is
                sensible-to-total capacity ratio at AHRI test
                conditions. This should be available in a
                manufacturer's performance brochure. Leave at default
                levels if not available.</li>
              <li><strong>Demand</strong>: Generally only use these
                fields if you must calculate a demand charge. Refer to
                the help topic for this feature (click on the info
                icon).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Staged and Variable-capacity units</strong>:
            Four of the "Advanced Features" facilitate
            modeling of variable-capacity systems.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The features</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>E-Fan and Condenser</strong>: Select
                    from three different system types: (1) one- or
                    two-stage units with a single-speed
                    evaporator fan, (2) units with multi-stage
                    condensers, and (3) units with a variable-capacity
                    condenser.</li>
                  <li><strong>Number of Stages</strong>: The number of
                    stages in a unit with a staged condenser. Leave
                    this set to 1 for single-stage and
                    variable-capacity units.</li>
                  <li><strong>N for Fan Energy Calcs</strong>: The
                    value of <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>
                    used in fan-affinity law calculations for
                    variable-speed fans. This should generally be left
                    at the default value. This feature has no impact
                    for a single-stage unit with a single-speed
                    evaporator fan.</li>
                  <li><strong>Condenser Fan</strong>: The fraction of
                    condenser power used by the condenser fan at AHRI
                    rating conditions. This fraction can usually be
                    estimated from a manufacturer's brochure. This
                    feature applies only (and can only be edited) if
                    the "V-Spd" unit is selected under the "<strong style="font-weight: normal;">E-Fan and
                      Condenser</strong>"
                    feature.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Examples</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Two-stage</strong> unit with a <strong>single-speed</strong>
                    evaporator fan: <br>
                    Set the "Number of Stages" feature to 2. Set the "<strong style="font-weight: normal;">E-Fan and
                      Condenser</strong>"
                    feature to one of the "1-Spd" choices.</li>
                  <li><strong>Two-stage</strong> unit with a <strong>two-speed</strong>
                    evaporator fan:<br>
                    Set the "Number of Stages" feature to 2. Set the "<strong style="font-weight: normal;">E-Fan and
                      Condenser</strong>"
                    feature to one of the "N-Spd" choices.</li>
                  <li><strong>Multi-stage</strong> unit with a
                  corresponding<strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
                  style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span>multi-speed</strong>
                    evaporator fan: This is the generalization of the previous
                    case.<br>
                    Change the "Number of Stages" feature to the corresponding
                    level. Set the "<strong style="font-weight: normal;">E-Fan
                    and Condenser</strong>" feature to one of the "N-Spd"
                    choices.</li>
                  <li>A unit with a <strong>variable-capacity
                  compressor</strong>, <strong>variable-speed condenser
                  fan</strong>, and <strong>variable-speed evaporator
                  fan</strong>: <br>
                    Set the "<strong style="font-weight: normal;">E-Fan
                      and Condenser</strong>" feature to the
                    "V-Spd" choice.<br>
                    <br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Three Specific Units</span>:</h2>
        <p>In contrast to the generic correction curves that are used in the
        modes described above, specific performance curves and algorithms are
        used to characterize these three units and are written into the computer
        code of the calculator's computation engine. These proprietary curves
        and algorithms were provided by the manufacturers. There is a
        <a class="Jump"
        href="methods/CoolingCorrectionCurves_3SpecificUnits.html">methods
        page</a> which provides background information on these units. Please
        also refer to the help topic for this feature.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Specific Candidate Unit</strong>: Use this advanced
            feature to select one of the three units. A selection here
            automatically sets values for several related calculator features:
            "E-Fan and Condenser" and "Number of Stages." These
            automatically-set values may need refinement depending on the
            specifics of the application. For example, when setting the
            “Specific Candidate Unit” feature to the “Advanced Controls” value
            this type of add-on technology can be applied to either a
            single-stage or two-stage unit. Similarly, depending on whether the
            unit’s evaporator fan is set to cycle with the compressor or run
            continuously will determine whether the “E-Fan and Condenser” setting
            needs refinement.</li>
          <li><strong>Other features</strong>: Selecting one these specific
          units defines its basic nature; however, additional parameters should
          be set to fully characterize a particular version of the unit. This
          includes all other RTU-related parameters that are used under the
          generic-mode approach described above: EER, capacity, power splits,
          S/T ratio, and degradation factor (if not V-Spd). Use default values
          if parameters can not be obtained from a manufacturer's brochure. As
          done above, the environment and economic parameters need to be set:
          State and City, Schedule, etc.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Spreadsheet Interface</span>:</h2>
        <p>The spreadsheet provides a general mechanism to characterize
        full-load and part-load performance of an RTU's condenser using tables
        from a manufacturer's performance brochure. Please review the help topic
        for the "Spreadsheet" feature. There is a <a
        href="methods/CoolingCorrectionCurves_Manufacturer.html"
        class="Jump">methods page</a>
          that provides additional information. The spreadsheet itself has
          additional instructions and annotation inside. Note that spreadsheet
          models are not allowed to be used with the "Specific Candidate Unit"
          feature.</p>
        <p>There are three levels of input data. Only the full-load
          data (first bullet below) is required. The second and third
          bullets describe optional inputs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full-load total gross capacity and condenser
          power</strong> (required): This data is readily available from
          manufacturers' performance tables. Some interpolation might be
          required as the spreadsheet needs this data at particular operating
          temperatures. This data alone can be used to replace the generic coil
          curves. The good news is that users can build a coil model from this
          data even if they do not have the additional data described below. If
          the user prefers to stop at this data level, there are two control
          cells in the spreadsheet for facilitating putting NAs (Not Available)
          in the S/T cells (B20 on the Full-Load Performance sheet) and NAs in
          the part-load tables (B3 on the Part-Load Performance sheet). The NAs
          will cause the calculator to use only the full-load coil data and
          activate its native apparatus dew-point method for S/T modeling and
          its native part-load modeling of fans and condensers for estimating
          part-load performance.</li>
          <li><strong>S/T data </strong>(not required): The sensible-to-total
          capacity ratios are also generally available from manufacturers.
          However the native S/T modeling in the calculator is capable of
          accounting for changing evaporator flow and condenser capacity levels.
          For this reason, the spreadsheet's S/T model is only recommended for
          systems with a single-stage and a single-speed evaporator fan.</li>
          <li><strong>Part-load data</strong> (not required): This type of
          tabulated data is currently not available for the public from
          manufacturers. As a result this portion of the spreadsheet is only a
          prototype and demonstrates how this part-load data could be structured
          in a way related to IEER calculations. The B3 cell on the part-load
          sheet can be used to turn this off (fill with NAs) or show example
          values that are generated with consideration for the part-load nature
          of a single-stage unit or a variable-capacity unit.</li>
