      <h2>Discussion:</h2>

      <p>Fan capacity, not used in ventilation, can optionally be used in
      economizing the load. The economizer reduces the sensible load, at outdoor
      temperatures below the setpoint, by fully opening the outside-air damper
      and bringing in additional ventilation air. When economizing, the supply
      fan runs at full speed.</p>

      <p>In the example chart (produced by the RTU Comparison Calculator) for
      Wichita, the "After Economizer" trace shows the final load data that will
      drive the run-time calculation (this trace is reduced to zero for those
      bins where the economizer can satisfy all the cooling load).</p>

      <p>For temperature bins where the economizer cannot satisfy the load on
      its own, supplemental DX cooling is modeled in the calculator in what is
      called integrated mode (see the 70F bin in Wichita chart). In this mode,
      the unit balances the load against the two cooling sources to determine
      how much DX runtime is needed in the hour. During the economizer-only
      portion of the hour the fan runs at full speed. During the DX-only portion
      of the hour the fan runs at full-speed for a single-speed system. However,
      for a variable-capacity unit, the DX-only portion of the hour runs at a
      fan speed that corresponds to the first-stage of a staged unit or the
      minimum capacity of a unit with a variable-capacity condenser.</p>

      <p>The final step in presenting the load data to the unit is to determine
      the number of hours in which the unit experiences that load. In the
      example chart for Wichita, with a schedule of Monday - Friday, 7am - 7pm,
      the hour distribution, as binned by outside temperature, is shown
      normalized, with a fine red line (max value = 254 hours). This line is
      labeled "Schedule." The potential total hours, as would be the case if no
      schedule were filtering the hours, is shown by the fine dark-brown line,
      labeled "Total Hours." This Total Hours trace is displayed for use as a
      reference to give the user a sense of the impact of the filtering by the
      schedule. When an "All Day, All Week" schedule is selected, these two
      traces (filtered and unfiltered) are identical and lay on top of each
      other.</p>

      <p>When considering how unit performance varies from city to city, it is
      useful to keep in mind that the building-load model (in this case:
      "Office-Medium") is scaled to match the capacity of the candidate unit at
      design conditions. As a result of this explicit balance, design
      temperature is not by itself a primary driver of energy usage, but rather
      two associated weather characteristics have more impact: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Hour count in the cooling bins (longer cooling season means more
        energy use).</li>
        <li>The skew of the hour distribution (the more skewed toward high
        temperatures, the more time at high load and low capacity; the result is
        longer run times per bin hour).</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The RTU Comparison Calculator reports calculation results for any
      temperature bin where there is a positive cooling load (before economizer
      reductions). </p>
