  <p>This help is a collection of topics for the features on the calculator's
    <em>Controls</em> page. These help topics can be accessed by clicking on the
    information icon next to a feature's name. This opens the help window and
    positions the corresponding topic at the top.
  </p>
  <p>Help topics are outlined as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Name: </strong>Following the feature's
      name is summary content that is similar to the pop-up tip that
      is viewed by positioning the mouse cursor over an
      information icon (and waiting a second or so). </p>
    <p><strong>Discussion: </strong>General tips on usage will be first in the
      discussion section. Following this may be qualitative discussions of
      expected behaviors when changing the values of this feature.</p>

    The calculator is tested and fully functional in Mozilla Firefox,
    Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Google Chrome. Performance
    and display characteristics are best in Firefox. Starting with calculator
    version 4.3, WebKit-based browsers such as Google Chrome are supported.</p>

  <p><a name="SavingRuns" id="SavingRuns"></a><strong>Submitting the
  <em>Controls</em> page (and saving the <em>Results</em> page):</strong> Click
  one of the "Submit" buttons or any of the gray divider rows to submit the
  <em>Controls</em> page to the calculation engine.</p>
  <p>The
    <em>Controls</em> and <em>Results</em> pages can
    be saved as local web pages to record run parameters and
    performance results. Note that a parameter-summary table is
    included on
    the <em>Results</em> page (after the "Results" table and chart).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Discussion: </strong>To capture the details of a calculator run, do a
    "save-page-as" from the browser and then pick the "web-page, complete" option.
    This works well from the Firefox and Google Chrome browsers. Google Chrome
    does the best job capturing all formatting details. Tables, images (graphs),
    and everything will be captured. (Note that currently the MS Internet Explorer
    browser does not properly capture the <em>Results</em> page.) From the saved
    local page, or directly from the original page, you can drag your cursor over
    tables and paste them into Excel for additional analysis.</p>
  <p>The <em>Controls</em> and <em>Results</em> pages can also be printed to multiple
    sheets of letter size paper. Print from the "File / Print" menu
    option
    and not the "File / Print preview" option.</p>

  <a name="Defaults" id="Defaults"></a><strong>Defaults:</strong>
  Use the "Restore" button to change all feature values back to the defaults
  shown in the far right column. If a feature has been
  changed
  from its default value, the background color of the corresponding
  cell
  in this column changes to a slightly darker shade. This color change
  is intended as an additional reminder to the user as to which
  features
  are actively being changed.
  <p>Most of the default values are static. However, some defaults are
    calculated (and updated) depending on the settings of other features.
    "Ventilation Rate" and the three "Power Inputs" features are examples of
    defaults that depend on other features.</p>
  <p>The "Power" button is displayed next to the "Restore" button if the
    "Advanced Features" are turned on. The "Power" button acts to reset the power
    draw values. Clicking the "Power" button will cause the three power fields
    (evaporator, auxiliary, and condenser) to be set to default levels as
    calculated based on current settings of the "EER" and "Capacity" features.

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion:</span>
  A custom load model
  is defined to describe the approximate linear
  relationship between the sensible-cooling load on the HVAC
  system and
  the difference between the
  inside and outdoor temperatures. The model is characterized by three
  parameters: (1) a slope parameter accounting for conduction,
  ventilation, and infiltration through the building envelope, (2) an
  intercept parameter accounting for internal loads, and (3) a
  ventilation-slope fraction parameter that specifies how much of the
  first parameter is caused by ventilation. Refer to the help section
  on <a class="Jump" href="#Building_Type">building
    types</a> for additional information. Appendix A in the <a href="docs/PNNL-24130.pdf"
    class="Jump" target="_blank">User
    Manual</a>
  PDF further describes the concepts and analysis behind this
  approach.<br>
  <br>
  The
  slope and intercept of the load model are scaled to produce a
  sensible
  load that is in balance with the sensible capacity of the RTU at
  design
  conditions. In a sense, the building is scaled (sized) to match the
  capacity of the cooling system. This scaling operation produces the
  final load-line that is
  processed in the binned analysis.<br>
  
  <hr>
  <p><a name="State"></a><strong>State/City:
    </strong>The "State" feature affects the lists of cities appearing
    in the "City" feature. The "State" and "City" features are used
    together to
    query weather data for this location. If your city is not listed,
    select the city whose climate is most similar yours (usually the
    closest city).</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Discussion:</strong> The calculator uses
    weather data
    to conduct a binned energy analysis for the RTU in cities across
    the
    United
    States. Weather tape data (outdoor dry-bulb and coincident
    web-bulb)
    was
    binned in 5 degree increments and filtered by the selected
    occupancy <a class="Jump" href="#Schedule">schedule</a>. The
    result is a database of hours (in each bin) and coincident
    wet-bulb
    temperatures for each city and schedule combination.
  </p>
  
  <hr>
  <p><a name="Schedule"></a><strong>Schedule:
    </strong>This defines the time during which the building is assumed to be
    occupied. For the unoccupied periods outside of this schedule, the air
    conditioner is assumed to be shut down (no runtime) or the thermostat is set
    back. The system behavior during unoccupied periods is determined by the
    “Indoor Temperature” and the “E-Fan and Condenser” features.</p>
  <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The "Schedule" feature
    filters the number of hours that can accumulate in a weather bin.
    Shorter
    occupant schedules translate into fewer potential hours where the
    cooling system can be subject to a load.</p>
  <p>The hours outside
    of this schedule are considered to be unoccupied if the "Indoor
    Temperature" feature is set to "Cond. Off."</p>
  <hr>
  <p><a name="Indoor_Temperature"></a><strong>Indoor
      Temperature: </strong>
    This is the thermostat setpoint. The second feature, "Setback,"
    acts to
    increase the cooling setpoint temperature during unoccupied hours.
    The
    cooling setpoint, during unoccupied hours, is calculated as the
    sum of
    these two features (base setpoint + setback = higher setpoint
    during
    the unoccupied hours). Additional information for this feature can
    be
    found in the topic for the <a class="Jump" href="#FanControls">E-Fan and Condenser</a> feature.</p>
  <p>This "Setback" feature acts to perform a double run. The
    load-line is established (locked) in the primary run (for occupied
    hours) at non-setback conditions. The same load-line is applied
    again
    in the secondary setback run for the unoccupied hours. The sum of
    the
    two runs is used to populate the energy categories in the
    "Results"
    table.</p>
  <p>A special case is considered when "Setback" is set to "Cond.
    Off."
    In this case the
    condenser and the evaporator fan are not allowed to run during
    unoccupied hours and during
    these unoccupied hours only auxiliary energy is
    calculated (and totaled). In this case bin calculations are not
    displayed for the
    unoccupied hours.<br>
  </p>
  <p>For all normal setback cases, both condenser and fan energy
    (and aux energy) are calculated during unoccupied hours. Turning
    on the
    "Show Bin Calculations" option will display separate bin
    calculations
    for these unoccupied hours. This is in addition to (displayed
    after)
    the occupied-hours bin calculations. (Note: there will be a link
    above
    each of the two "Loads and Hours" plots for
    the candidate unit. Clicking this link will scroll/jump the page
    back
    and forth between the occupied and the unoccupied-hours results.
    Just
    clicking this twice will put this jump into the browser's page
    history
    and then you can use the Alt-arrow keys (hold Alt key down, then
    try
    the left and right arrow keys) to toggle back and forth. This can
    be
    a useful trick for visually comparing the occupied and unoccupied
    results.)</p>
  <p>Note that for staged systems using normal setback, the
    evaporator
    fan will cycle with the compressor
    during the unoccupied hours. However if the special case of "Cond.
    Off"
    is selected, the condenser and the evaporator fan are always off
    during
    unoccupied hours.</p>
  <p>The "Schedule" (Scheduled Hours) trace is shown in
    the "Loads and Hours" chart. This illustrates the occupied hours
    where
    the condenser is allowed to operate as established by the selected
    schedule. The "Total Hrs" trace shows all the hours (sum of
    occupied
    and unoccupied). Note that for normal setback, the
    "Schedule" trace in the "Loads and Hours" chart for
    unoccupied
    hours
    will represent the unoccupied hours (i.e. the hours where the
    condenser is active in the setback run for the unoccupied times).</p>
  <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> When interpreting the
    impact of changes to the thermostat "Indoor Temperature" setpoint feature,
    consideration
    must be given to whether the non-ventilation load-line is locked
    or
    not. If the load-line is locked, this feature will give the most
    intuitive results. However, in the default state (load-line
    un-locked),
    the impact of this feature may be less than expected. Consider the
    following example:</p>
  <table width="394">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="175">Indoor Temperature </th>
        <th width="207">Candidate Unit (kWhrs) </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td> 75 </td>
        <td>10,798 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 70 </td>
        <td>12,807</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 70L (line locked @ 75) </td>
        <td>14,670</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="2"> Note: All other calculator parameters are at
          default values. </td>
      </tr>
    </tfoot>
  </table>
  <p>For the <em>locked</em> case (third row in table
    above), the primary
    driver behind the larger increase is that the non-ventilation
    load-line
    is not
    automatically adjusting to accommodate the more severe conditions
    at
    the lower
    setpoint (see discussion on the <a class="Jump" href="#Lock_load_line">locking</a> feature). So the
    effect of the original non-ventilation load-line (based on
    delta-T) is
    clearly increased by the lower setpoint.</p>
  <p>In the contrasting <em>un-locked</em> case
    (second row), the load-line
    is defined to be in balance with the capacity (see <a class="Jump" href="methods/NonVentilationLoad.html">methods
      page</a>). So the change in setpoint has a less direct impact on
    the
    consumption. This is because the lower return temperatures
    adversely
    affect mixed-air conditions and the corresponding system
    performance.
    And
    to achieve balance between total sensible load and the reduced
    capacity, the
    total sensible load must be reduced. Therefore, the primary driver
    behind
    the increase in consumption, for this case, is not directly loads,
    but
    rather
    seen most strongly in two associated effects:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Mixed-air conditions</em>: The lower
        return temperature affects the load-line calculation (at
        design), the
        capacity (at bin conditions), and the power (at bin
        conditions) used
        while satisfying the load. The overall effect is an increase
        in power
        usage (see similar discussion of the un-locked case for the
        "Ventilation
        Rate" feature) </li>
      <li><em>More cooling bins</em>: The lower
        setpoint essentially extends the cooling season. There are
        more bins
        where the cooling loads are satisfied by the economizer but
        still add
        to energy consumption because of fan power. </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the setpoint affects the mixed-air
    conditions (for both locked and un-locked cases). The lower return
    temperature adversely affects the sensible capacity which
    dominates
    the performance-correction effects (see the bin data
    for the
    overall correction
    factor (OCF)). The OCF factor is higher for the lower setpoint
    cases.
    Higher OCF factors
    correspond to higher consumption.</p>
  
  <hr>
  <p><a name="Indoor_Relative_Humidity"></a><strong>Indoor
      Relative Humidity: </strong>Uncheck the "auto" feature to
    specify a fixed humidity level.
    In "auto" mode the inside humidity reflects outdoor
    conditions. In "fixed" mode, the indoor relative humidity is
    assumed to
    be
    controlled to a fixed value.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Discussion:</strong> The "auto" mode models
    the interior humidity as <em>tracking</em> the outdoor conditions.
    Tracking is equivalent to assuming a moisture mass balance if moisture
    gains (from people and processes) equal moisture losses from condensate.
    This approximation is a simple way to model humidity conditions if no
    other information is known about moisture dynamics in the building. The
    tracking mode calculates the interior relative humidity and wet-bulb by
    assuming the moisture content of the interior air is equivalent to that of
    the exterior air on a humidity ratio basis (i.e., mass of water per mass
    of dry air is equivalent inside and out). The tracking mode is constrained
    to allow indoor humidity of values no less than 20% and no more that 65%.
    (The "auto" mode generally overestimates the interior humidity ratio. This
    assumption tends to overestimate associated latent loads. There is a
    discussion of this assumption in Section A.7 of the
    <a class="Jump" href="docs/PNNL-24130.pdf" target="_blank">User Manual</a>.)<br>
    <br>
    Alternatively a "fixed" mode is used if the "auto" feature is
    de-selected. In "fixed" mode, the interior humidity ratio is
    assumed
    fixed (at the user selected level) and is not affected by the
    outside
    conditions.<br>
    <br>
    If you know the typical humidity levels in your building during
    the
    summer, use the "fixed" mode (especially if you have an associated
    piece of equipment that controls the humidity). If not, use the
    "auto"
    mode. Note that the calculator does not determine
    the
    energy usage of any associated humidification or dehumidification
    devices. It strictly calculates energy estimates for the air
    conditioner.<br>
    <br>
    The following reference discusses empirical validation of
    simplified
    methods for modeling humidity: Miller, J.D., "Development and
    Validation of a Moisture Mass Balance Model for Predicting
    Residential
    Cooling Energy Consumption," ASHRAE Transactions, Vol. 90, pt. 2,
    1984,
    (275-293).<br>
    <br>
    Note that a <a class="Jump" href="methods/EquipmentResponse_Latent.html">sensible load analysis</a> best
    represents a thermostat's sensible nature and is key in supporting the
    calculations that are affected by humidity and latent loads. A
    sensible thermostat responds to temperature changes and sends requests to
    the unit to remove the sensible cooling load. The effects of humidity are
    accounted for in how the unit's sensible capacity is diminished by humidity
    in the entering air (mixture of outside and return).<br>
    <br>
    The change to a sensible analysis (in revision 2.0), from the
    original
    total-energy analysis, changes the question the
    calculation answers from:<br>
    <u><br>
      Total energy question<br>
    </u>Given the unit's total capacity at the specified entering
    conditions, AND assuming that all sensible and latent loads are
    met by
    the unit,
    how much energy would it consume in satisfying the total load?<br>
    <br>
    To this one:<u><br>
      <br>
      Sensible energy question</u><br>
    Given the unit's available sensible capacity at the specified
    entering
    conditions, AND that the unit is controlled by a thermostat (a
    purely
    sensible device), how much energy would it consume in satisfying
    the
    sensible component of the total
    load?

Manual changes support comparisons with version 4.0 of the RTUCC.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Instead, please use the editable fields associated with the "Building Type" control to establish a custom load line.</span> Also note that manual changes to the S&amp;I factor persist only until this form is updated. An update will cause a calculated value to replace the manual entry.</p> <p><strong>Discussion: </strong>The <em>Solar and Internal Gains</em> control allows for qualitative characterization of the buildings sensitivity to internal cooling loads (all loads not driven by outside temperature). The S&amp;I loads include all cooling loads except ventilation and conduction. This includes loads such as occupancy related internal loads (waste heat from lighting and plug loads) and also solar loads. These internal loads are assumed to be independent of outside conditions and constant through out the day.<br /> <br /> Increasing the S&amp;I fraction results in a less steep load line (less sensitive to outside temperature) and decreasing the S&amp;I fraction makes for a steeper load line (more sensitivity to outside temperature). Setting the S&amp;I load fraction to zero is equivalent to modeling a building with no internal gains or windows (e.g., air conditioned storage building). With "Show bin calculations" selected, notice that increasing the S&amp;I factor essentially lengthens the cooling season (more cooling bins are proceeded).<br /> <br /> Note that the S&amp;I control has no effect if the non-ventilation load line is <a class="Jump" href="#Lock_load_line">locked</a>. </p> -->

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>The "Cycles with Compressor" fan modes will cycle the blower
    fan
    with the compressor during both occupied and unoccupied hours. In
    this
    case the fan is completely off whenever the compressor is off. An
    exception to this occurs when the economizer is active. When
    economizing, the blower fan always runs at full speed.</p>
  <p>The
    “…Always ON” fan-mode choices for staged units will cause the
    blower
    fan to be “…Always ON” during occupied hours, but will cycle
    the fan with the compressor during unoccupied hours. In other
    words,
    the "...Always ON" mode runs the fan at all times during occupied
    hours, but cycles during unoccupied hours. The fan is
    effectively in "Cycles With Compressor" mode during unoccupied
    hours.</p>
  <p>The behavior
    of the system during unoccupied hours is affected by the
    "Setback"
    feature which determines if the condenser is allowed to run during
    that
    time. When the "Setback" feature is set
    to "Cond. Off,"
    then DX cooling and the evaporator fan are kept off during the
    unoccupied hours. When
    the "Setback" feature is set to any
    value other than "Cond. Off," then DX cooling is allowed during
    unoccupied hours and at loads as determined by a reduced
    thermostat
    setpoint.</p>
  <p>A special case where the condenser and the evaporator
    fan
    are OFF during
    unoccupied hours can be investigated by setting the "Setback"
    feature to "Cond. Off." This will set everything OFF
    during
    unoccupied hours independent of how the "E-Fan and Condenser"
    feature
    is set.</p>
  <p>(For clarity, the following two paragraphs restate the
    information above from a different perspective: condenser ON or
    OFF.)</p>
  Blower-fan energy, when the
  condenser is OFF, is handled in three ways: (1) If a “Cycles…” fan
  mode
  is in effect, the blower fan is completely off when the condenser is
  off, (2) if a “…Always On” fan mode is in effect, the unit will
  reduce
  fan speeds if it can (e.g. an N-Spd or V-Spd fan) to levels that
  support ventilation, (3) whenever the economizer is active the fan
  runs
  at full speed.<br>
  <br>
  Blower-fan energy when the condenser is ON
  depends on the type of the unit, but basically the fan fraction goes
  up
  and down with the capacity fraction for any unit except those with
  single-speed fans. The main exception to this is when the economizer
  is
  active; then the fan always runs at full speed.
  <p>The "N-Spd:" fan-mode choice is a valid option only when the
    unit has two or more
    stages. If the "Stages" feature is not set to "2" or higher, a
    warning
    message is displayed when the user attempts to "Submit" to the
    calculation engine.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion:</span> </p>
  <p>A
    noteworthy special case is a system with two stages and a
    single-speed
    fan. A single-speed fan system runs at one speed (full speed)
    during
    both first-stage and second-stage compressor operation. This
    system, if
    there
    are two stages, is assumed to have a row-split evaporator design
    (i.e., essentially two evaporator coils in series, one after
    the
    other, subject to the same air flow from one blower fan). The
    row-split
    design yields
    high sensible (less latent) performance when only the first-stage
    is
    active as compared to when both
    stages are active. In first-stage mode, the coil will be warmer
    and
    therefore yield a more sensible output (high fan flow coupled with
    lower
    condenser cooling cause warmer supply temperatures). This
    higher
    sensible capacity in the first stage can be seen in the calculator
    by
    looking at the S/T values in the tables and charts for bins
    where the first stage is active without the second stage.<br>
  </p>
  The following table illustrates the variation in evaporator (blower)
  fan energy usage as affected by parameters in the calculator: (1)
  economizer mode, (2) setback mode, (3) condenser mode, and (4) fan
  mode. The results shown here are for the candidate unit.
  All parameters not represented in the table are set to default
  levels. Fan energies ran from the high of 3,167 kWhrs, to the low of
  397 for a variable-speed
  fan that adjusts to reduce fan speeds when additional flow is not
  needed.<br>
  <br>
  Generally,
  the table shows reductions in fan energy for systems that can reduce
  fan speeds when full-flow is not needed. Also, the control option of
  allowing the fan to cycle with the compressor reduces the fan use
  and
  energy consumption. When the economizer is active, the fan savings
  of
  a "V-Spd" and "N-Spd" system are reduced (because the fan runs at
  full
  speed
  while economizing). The "1-Spd" fan
  consumes the most fan energy because it's always running at
  full speed.<br>
  <br>
  It helps to consider a few specific comparisons in the table: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Note
      that the 2,347 for the 2-stage unit (in row 6) is higher than
      the 2,088
      for the 1-stage unit (in row 5). Because of the setback mode,
      the condenser is active and the fan is cycling with it during
      unoccupied hours. The 1-stage unit satisfies the load with
      shorter
      condenser run-times (always running at full capacity). So there
      is more
      fan-only time
      (which means more time when the fan is off) during the
      unoccupied
      hours with the 1-stage unit. A result, the 1-stage unit uses
      less fan
      energy in this case.</li>
    <li>Contrast the above case with the corresponding two rows in
      the "Cond. Off" block of
      runs: 1,498 for both cases. The two systems yield identical
      results
      here because the fan is always on during occupied hours and
      always
      off during unoccupied hours.</li>
    <li>Contrast two cases for the variable-speed fan: 397 (4th
      row) but
      1,782 in the last row. The last run has more requirements for
      the fan
      to be running at full speed. As a result, the distinction
      between
      1-Spd, 2-Spd, and V-Spd units in the last group of runs
      is smaller
      than the other three groups of runs.</li>

  Capacity unloading can be achieved by multiple stages or other variable
  capacity methods. Consider a two-stage unit with a two-speed fan. A
  two-speed fan system has a lower fan speed when running only the first
  stage. Based on fan-affinity laws, power consumption at the lower fan speed
  (1/2 the air flow of the high-speed mode) is assumed to be one eighth
  ((1/2)^3=1/8) of the high-speed power specified in "EFn" field on the
  <em>Controls</em> page. Note: this feature is only visible when the "Advanced
  Features" are turned on. When only ventilating, the two-speed system
  runs at its lower fan speed.<br>
  <p>The variable-speed choice represents a system that has a
    variable-speed
    evaporator fan and a variable-capacity condenser. Variable
    capacity is
    achieved either though many stages or other capacity-unloading
    methods.
    Detailed part-load condenser-performance behavior can be
    represented
    through the <a class="Jump" href="#SpreadsheetData">spreadsheet
      interface</a>. The spreadsheet data represents the condenser fan
    and the compressor at part-load conditions and can be used
    to account for condenser fans that can reduce their speed. When
    either
    of the variable-speed options is selected, the
    "Stages" feature is effectively disabled and all bin results are
    reported in the columns for the first stage. The
    cycling-degradation
    factor is set to zero when either of the two variable-speed modes
    is
    selected; it is assumed that the variable-speed unit does not
    cycle.<br>
    <br>
    Both variable-speed and staged-condenser systems run
    the condenser and evaporator
    fan at capacity levels needed to satisfy the
    sensible load. At reduced
    load, capacity and fan air flow are reduced together, yielding
    different sensible-latent splitting (as determined
    by the apparatus dew-point and bypass factor method) of the total
    capacity. These systems are
    assumed to have either a
    row-split or interlaced evaporator design (serial air flow from
    one
    multi-speed fan).

  <p><a name="DegradationFactor"></a><strong>Degradation
      Factor: </strong>
    Part-load degradation factor (percent).
  </p>
  <p>This value controls how much the unit performance is degraded
    as a
    function of load fraction. At no load, performance is degraded by
    this
    percentage. At full load, the degradation is zero. A linear
    relationship is used
    for load fractions between these two extremes. </p>
  <hr>
  <p><a name="N_Affinity"></a><strong>N Affinity:
    </strong>N (exponent value) used in fan-affinity law calculations.</p>
  <p>This value sets the exponent in the fan power calculations.
    For
    example, if the fan runs at one half of its flow capacity, the
    power it
    consumes will be (1/2)^N of its full-flow power draw. If N is 3,
    then
    at one half flow it will consume (1/2)^3 or 1/8 of its full-flow
    power.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion:</span></p>
  <p>An
    N of 3 is considered to represent the theoretical fan-affinity law
    behavior for an ideal fan and yields a high-end estimate of the
    fan
    energy savings associated with a multi-speed fan. At lower fan
    speeds
    this value is considered to overestimate fan savings. An N value
    of
    2.5 is typically accepted as an exponent that best represents
    overall fan behavior.</p>
  <p>An N of 3.0 was assumed for all calculator versions before 4.3.</p>

  <p>The web application produces four regression models from the
    pasted data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gross Total Capacity</strong>: <br>
      Function of ODB (Outside Dry-Bulb) temperature and EWB (Entering
      Wet-Bulb) temperature. <br>
      This is a <strong>relative</strong> model and depends on
      the nominal capacity value set on the <em>Controls</em> page.</li>
    <li><strong>Condenser Power</strong>: <br>
      Function of ODB and EWB. <br>
      This is a <strong>relative</strong> model and depends on
      the nominal condenser power value set on the <em>Controls</em> page.</li>
    <li><strong>S/T Ratio</strong>:<br>
      Function of ODB, EWB, and EDB (Entering Dry-Bulb) temperature. <br>
      This is an <strong>absolute</strong> model and ignores the
      nominal S/T value set on the <em>Controls</em> page.</li>
    <li><strong>Part-Load Performance</strong>: <br>
      Normalized EER (excluding blower-fan power), as a function of load
      fraction and ODB. The EER data is first normalized by the first row in the
      part-load performance table (the 100% load EER), so data feeding this
      regression is relative to the full-load performance in the first row. This
      essentially captures the part-load behavior of the condenser (and its fan)
      and is used with the full-load condenser-power model above. The part-load
      behavior of the evaporator blower fan is accounted for separately with
      fan-affinity laws. The end result of this is a<strong>
        relative </strong>part-load model of the condenser which
      ignores
      the nominal degradation factor set on the <em>Controls</em> page.<br />
      <br />
      If part-load data comes to the calculator from the spreadsheet interface,
      the spreadsheet data will take priority in modeling condenser's part-load
      behavior. The energy use of the evaporator fan is <b>always</b> <b>modeled
        in the calculator</b>. So if you are modeling the condenser behavior with
      the spreadsheet, you will still need to specify the characteristics of the
      evaporator fan in the calculator. The following two features of the
      calculator <b>must</b> be used to characterize the evaporator fan: "Number
      of Stages" and "E-Fan and Condensor."

  <p>A <span class="Jump">sample spreadsheet</span>
    is provided to illustrate and test the import feature. Right-click
    on
    the link and then choose to open or choose to save ("Save Link
    As...")
    the Excel file to your computer. Note that this spreadsheet is
    version
    marked to insure compatibility with the web application. Paste
    operations from older versions will not be accepted. </p>
  <p>This sample spreadsheet has two "scratch" sheets that
    illustrate how supporting data be can be found in PDF format on
    manufacturers' web sites and used for this feature. One of the
    scratch
    sheets shows the raw images of the supporting tables (from a
    Lennox
    PDF). The other sheet shows intermediate tables that were
    assembled by
    pasting data from the PDF into the spreadsheet.</p>
  <p>The "Part-Load Performance" sheet has detailed part-load
    performance data that serves to characterize the part-load
    behavior of
    the condenser. The upper table of data on this sheet corresponds
    to the
    part-load data that is used to determine a unit's IEER value. As a
    confirmation of this, the cells on the diagonal of the upper table
    are
    used to calculate the unit's IEER (the IEER result is shown on
    this
    sheet). For modeling work, the off-diagonal cells in the table are
    needed to characterize the part-load behavior as a function of
    load
    fraction and the outdoor dry-bulb. The lower table specifically
    represents the condenser unit and has the evaporator-fan power and
    evaporator-fan heat subtracted out of the EERs in the upper table.
    These special EER-Cond values are needed to represent the
    condenser's
    part-load behavior (including the condenser fan). The equation for
    calculating EER-Cond is given on the "Part-Load Performance"
    sheet.
    Only the YELLOW cells on the "Part-Load Performance" sheet feed
    into
    the regression models. As mentioned above, the part-load behavior
    of
    the evaporator's blower fan is accounted for separately with
    fan-affinity laws.</p>
  <p>Note, however, that the "Part-Load Performance" data will
    almost never be available on a manufacturer's web site. In the
    future,
    fully populated spreadsheets, including the part-load data, may be
    available for download from the calculator site. These will be provided
    to
    us from manufacturers for a selected set of rooftop units. But for
    now,
    leave this data set to NA or try out the feature using the test
    data
    that is provided with the sample spreadsheet.</p>
  <p>Steps for importing the spreadsheet data:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Copy</strong>:<br>
      Copy all the data on the "Data Summary" sheet. Using <span style="font-style: italic;">control-a</span> is one
      way to
      select a whole sheet. Another is to click the little corner cell
      in the
      upper left, or simply drag with your cursor over all the active
      cells
      in the sheet. The part-load data (last four rows of the Data
      Summary
      sheet), may optionally be excluded if the manufacturer's
      part-load data
      is not available.</li>
    <li><strong>Paste</strong>:<br>
      Turn on the "Advanced Features" on the web site first. Paste
      this data
      into the appropriate "Spreadsheet Data" cell on the <em>Controls</em>
      page.
      There is one spreadsheet cell for the Candidate unit and one for
      the
      Standard unit. After pasting, the cell may appear empty (blank);
      not
      until after step 3 will there be visible text in the cell (so
      don't
      double paste). Note: to remove data from a "Spreadsheet Data"
      cell, put
      the cursor in the cell, then use <span style="font-style:
          italic;">control-a</span> (to
      select all the content
      in the cell), then use <span style="font-style: italic;">control-x</span>
      (to clear it).</li>
    <li><strong>Click the check box</strong> (just to
      the right of the spreadsheet field):<br>
      This sets features to reflect the corresponding values in the
      spreadsheet (e.g. EER, net capacity, evaporator fan power, aux
      power,
      condenser power, and S/T ratio). Note, after pasting spreadsheet
      data,
      the check box is checked automatically if you click anywhere
      (outside
      the spreadsheet cell) on the page. After clicking the check box,
      the
      model number of the unit will be displayed in the spreadsheet
      cell.</li>
    <li><strong>Submit</strong>:<br>
      Click the "Submit" button. On the report page, you'll see the
      raw sheet
      contents parsed and reconstituted by the engine and displayed.
      There
      will also be a table for each of the four regression models that
      have
      been developed (the table indicates the model form and the model
      coefficients and their corresponding T values). If data is
      insufficient
      for modeling, a warning message will be displayed where the
      regression
      model table would normally be displayed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>After pasting in the data, the cell background color for the <strong>"S/T
      Ratio</strong>" and the "<strong>Degradation Factor</strong>"
    features will be a light yellow. This is a warning that these
    features
    are effectively disabled if the modeling process succeeds. The
    corresponding S/T model and degradation model are <strong>absolute</strong>
    and do not use these values. It is best to think of the values for
    these
    features as backups that will be used if the corresponding part of
    the
    modeling process fails (or if insufficient data is provided). The
    report page will indicate which of the models have succeeded.
    Again,
    there will be corresponding warning messages for those that fail.</p>
  <p>All the other features on the <em>Controls</em> page are still active
    and can be changed by the user. Note that by unchecking the check
    box
    (also see step 3 above), you are then free to edit the nominal
    values
    for any of the parameters brought in by the spreadsheet (i.e.,
    EER, net
    capacity, blower power, aux power, and condenser power).
    Re-checking
    the check box then brings back the nominal spreadsheet values and
    displays them on the <em>Control</em> page. Note that the "Power" (top
    right)
    button (see help for the <a class="Jump" href="#FanCondAux">power
      fields</a>) will act to uncheck this check box and set the the
    power fields to their default levels; re-checking the check box
    will
    again display the values from the spreadsheet.</p>
  <p>The regression models will be in effect as long as there is
    spreadsheet data in the spreadsheet field (regardless of the check
    box
    state). To remove data from a "Spreadsheet Data" field, put the
    cursor
    in the field, then use <span style="font-style: italic;">control-a</span>
    (to select all the content in the
    field), then use <span style="font-style: italic;">control-x</span>
    (to clear it).</p>

  <p><a name="Ventilation_Rate"></a><strong>Ventilation
      Rate: </strong>
    Specify in CFM or as a percent of the fan capacity. Remaining fan
    capacity (not used in ventilation) is available for use by the
    economizer.</p>
  <p>Ventilation rates are calculated automatically when a building
    type is selected. Ventilation rates are calculated so as to
    produce the
    same fractional contribution to the slope of load-line as was
    determined in a corresponding EnergyPlus analysis of these
    building
    types (see the <a class="Jump" href="#Building_Type">Building
      Type</a> feature). Updating any feature that affects this
    calculation will cause the ventilation rate to be updated.
    Manually
    entered values are allowed but will only persist until a
    ventilation-rate update is triggered by changing the value of a
    related
    feature (for example the city/state).</p>
  <p>An alternate method for establishing the ventilation level is
    by
    adjusting the ventilation fraction in a custom building-load model
    (see
    the <a class="Jump" href="#Building_Type">Building
      Type</a>
    feature).</p>
  <p>When the Ventilation Rate feature is in the "% of fan
    capacity" mode, the ventilation parameter can be set anywhere
    between
    0% (entering mixed air is composed completely of return air) to
    100%
    (entering mixed air is composed completely of outside air) of the
    fan's
    capacity. This parameter range is equivalent to changing the fresh
    air
    damper from fully closed (0%) to fully open (100%). <br>
    <br>
    When in the "CFM" mode, values above 100% of fan capacity may be
    allowed. CFM values in excess of primary fan capacity are
    assumed to be supported by a secondary fan.
  </p>
  <p> For both the "% of fan capacity" and the "CFM" modes,
    ventilation values are not allowed to exceed levels where the
    non-ventilation load would be less than
    the internal load (i.e., a negative conduction load is not
    allowed; see
    <a class="Jump" href="methods/NonVentilationLoad.html">Methods</a>
    page). An error message is reported to the user in this case.
    Another
    way to look at this issue is to remember that the design load is
    calculated to match the design capacity and that as ventilation is
    increased the non-ventilation loads must decrease to maintain the
    match. However, ventilation levels are not allowed beyond the
    point
    where the non-ventilation load model would have a negative slope
    (an
    envelope better than a perfect insulator). <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Discussion:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Effect of location (city/state) on calculated
    ventilation levels:</p>
  <p>You may notice that the calculated ventilation rates change as
    the city and state change; the milder the climate (i.e., cooler
    summer
    design temperature) the higher the
    ventilation rate. The milder climate causes the unit to have a
    larger
    effective capacity (better coil performance) at the cooler design
    conditions, and because our building
    auto-sizes to balance loads with capacity at design conditions,
    this
    mean higher loads from all contributing components, including
    ventilation. Our building model assumes that ventilation
    contributes a
    certain fraction of the slope in the load model. This fractional
    contribution from ventilation is only dependent on building type
    and
    does not change with location. However, even
    though the
    fraction stays constant, the actual ventilation CFM will increase
    as
    the design loads are increased for milder climates. You can think
    of
    this as a
    larger building (to match the higher capacity) requiring more
    ventilation because it
    has more square footage.The ventilation portion of the load
    is specified for each load model (see Appendix A in the
    <a class="Jump" target="_blank" href="docs/PNNL-24130.pdf">User
      Manual</a>) and is
    also apparent in the "loads-and-hours" bin-calc plots as the difference
    between the "total" and "non-ventilation" lines.
  </p>
  <p>Impact of ventilation changes as influenced by
    competing effects:</p>
  <p>As intuitively expected, increasing ventilation levels
    generally causes higher consumption (and higher savings) to be
    reported
    by the calculator. But there are several competing
    effects that can
    cause unexpected changes in consumption as ventilation
    increases. Settings of associated parameters in the calculator
    determine the
    relative impact of
    these competing effects. The following outline discusses these
    associated
    parameters from within the context of a locked or unlocked
    load-line:</p>

      </tr>
    </tfoot>
  </table>
  <p>The table above contrasts the savings as affected by changes
    in ventilation levels (all other settings are at default values).
    The
    first row
    is the base case of 24% ventilation flow. The second row shows the
    results
    when the ventilation feature is manually set to 50%. The third row
    shows
    the result when the calculator starts at a ventilation rate of 24%,
    then
    locks the non-ventilation load-line, then changes the ventilation
    to
    50%. A comparison of rows 1 and 3 illustrates that an
    expected
    increase in consumption can essentially be nullified if the
    ventilation is increased when the
    load-line
    is locked (see explanation below in the "locked" section). Higher
    ventilation rates (rows 4 and 5) show an expected increase in
    consumption.</p>
  <p>If non-ventilation load-line is <em><b> un-locked
      </b></em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><em></em>As ventilation increases, the
      composition of the load
      changes but the overall load is still constrained to match the
      unit's
      capacity at design conditions. If it were not for the
      effect
      of
      ventilation
      on the mixed-air conditions, there would be essentially <u> NO
        effect</u> by ventilation on consumption in the
      un-locked case.
      Put in other words, in the un-locked case, changes in
      consumption are
      not directly caused by changes in ventilation load; these
      ventilation
      changes have only a very minor effect on the
      total-sensible load-line. (As a result, the truncating effect,
      where
      there can be less fan
      energy because of fewer cooling bins, rarely happens in the
      un-locked
      case; this is described below for the locked
      case.)<br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Mixed-air</b> conditions may become more
      favorable to the load-line and system performance as ventilation
      increases. The mixed-air conditions (and how they affect the
      unit's
      sensible capacity and power draw) are predominately responsible
      for
      changes in consumption as ventilation levels change. Consider
      the three
      primary steps where the mixed-air conditions have influence:
      <ol>
        <li><b>The design point</b>: The load-lines are
          based on the sensible capacity at the design point. Unlike
          when in
          locked mode, here the non-ventilation line is re-calculated
          with each
          parameter change. The weather conditions and ventilation
          rates (and
          corresponding mixed-air conditions) at the design point
          affect the
          sensible capacity at design and the resulting load-line.</li>
        <li>The bin calculations of <b>sensible capacity</b>:
          Bin conditions determine how the equipment (sensible
          capacity) can
          respond (runtime) to the load-line. </li>
        <li>The bin calculations of <b>power draw</b>:
          Bin conditions determine how much power is used while the
          system is
          running.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  If non-ventilation load-line is <b><em>
      locked</em></b>
  <ul>
    <li>Fewer <b> cooling bins</b> and less fan
      energy: Cooling bins that have total sensible-cooling load less
      than
      zero are excluded from the analysis. Increasing ventilation can
      decrease the number of cooling bins (below the setpoint) because
      ventilation cooling satisfies the internal gains and results in
      no
      cooling load. This effectively shortens the cooling season for
      the
      unit. The shortening occurs in bins of minor internal loads
      where the
      fan-only mode is predominant (economizer is satisfying the load
      without
      much compressor on time). The result is that low temperature
      bins are
      often truncated from the analysis as ventilation increases.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Oversizing</b> strengthens this effect
          because when the system is oversized, fan energy accounts
          for a higher
          fraction of the total system energy use.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Mixed-air</b> conditions (from increased
      ventilation) may be favorable to system performance. </li>
    <li><b>Internal gains</b> are better satisfied (in
      bins below the setpoint; especially true if the economizer is
      disabled): </li>

  <p><a name="Lock_load_line"></a><strong>Lock
      load-line: </strong>Preserves the current non-ventilation
    load-line for use in any submits that follow.</p>
  <p> Locking the non-ventilation load-line is equivalent to fixing
    the characteristics of a fictitious building that is the source of
    the
    cooling loads. Locking causes loads that are associated with
    internal
    gains to be fixed. Loads associated with conduction through the
    envelope
    are still driven by weather conditions, but the relationship to
    the
    temperature differential is fixed (slope of the load-line is
    fixed).
    Ventilation
    loads can still be adjusted after locking either by directly
    editing
    the ventilation value or by changing the building type or the
    ventilation parameter of a custom load model.</p>
  <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> In the default
    (unlocked) mode, loads are calculated so as to balance the unit's
    capacity at design conditions. Total sensible loads automatically
    adjust to balance capacity (also see the <a class="Jump" href="methods/NonVentilationLoad.html">Methods page</a>
    on the non-ventilation load for additional discussion). This
    principal
    assumption
    in the calculator can lead to counterintuitive (but
    correct)
    results in some of the features. For example, starting from the
    humidity feature's default "fixed mode" (not auto mode) value of
    60%
    relative humidity, and then changing to 40%, results in a
    significant
    drop in consumption if the load-line is locked (when at the
    original value of 60% humidity). A strong drop results when the
    load-line is locked because sensible non-ventilation loads stay <em>
      fixed</em> as sensible capacity <em> increases</em>
    at lower humidity levels. The result is <em>lower</em> run
    times.</p>

  Locking the non-ventilation load-line can be useful in testing
  the sensitivities to a parameter. Locking changes the "question"
  that
  is presented to the calculator. Consider, for
  example,
  the ventilation level parameter:
  <blockquote>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        <strong>If </strong><strong><em>
            locked</em></strong><strong> the question is</strong>:
        For fixed building characteristics, what is the energy impact
        of
        changing the ventilation level from:
        <ol>
          <li>an initial state where loads and capacities balance
            at design conditions, </li>
          <li> to a new state (different ventilation) where total
            loads are <em>free</em> to be higher or lower
            (non-ventilation load is <strong> <em>locked</em></strong>)
            than capacity at design? </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>If<em> not locked</em> the
          question is</strong>: For an "adjustable" building that can
        adapt
        to be in balance with loads, what is the energy impact of
        changing the
        ventilation level from:
        <ol>
          <li>an initial state where loads and capacities balance
            at design conditions, </li>
          <li> to a new state (different ventilation) where loads
            and capacity are again <em> constrained</em> to match and
            where the matching is again achieved by adjusting the
            non-ventilation
            load (the conduction component of the "adjustable"
            building)?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Or more simply put, once in locked mode, the non-ventilation
    building characteristics are fixed. When not locked, the
    "adjustable"
    building adjusts (conduction loads) to achieve balance between the
    specified ventilation load and the capacity of the unit.
  </p>
  <p>Note:
    when using the locking feature, it may be best to use some
    "oversizing"
    to allow for extra capacity to accommodate load changes. The
    oversizing
    feature can help to minimize the number of bins where runtimes
    exceed
    1.0. When locked, runtimes exceeding 1.0 are highlighted with
    light
    yellow

    S/T results for a variety of operating conditions, all at the
    capacity
    and flow rate established in the second line of features, all
    dependent
    on the <em>A0</em> term established by the first row of
    features. By default the second line is set to equal the first
    line
    whenever a first-line feature is changed.
